A simple plugin manager with a search box, that installs and auto updates plugins from GitHub.

Plugin developers, feel free to add your plugins to this repo in one easy steps:
1. Edit plugins.json to add an entry for your plugin. Mandatory fields to add a plugin to the catalog are: id, name, and url. All other fields are optional.
