# Easy-Diffusion-Plugins
A simple plugin manager with a search box, that installs and auto updates plugins from GitHub.

Devs, feel free to add your plugins to this repo. Mandatory fields to add a plugin to the catalog are: id, name, and url. All other fields are optional.
Please note the root folder is hardcoded, so you have to submit BOTH the plugin (in the plugins folder) and the catalog entry.
